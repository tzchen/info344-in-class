# WebSockets Demo Client

This very simple WebSockets client is already written for you. Open the index.html file, or use a auto-reloading like live-server:

```bash
# if you don't already have live-server installed...
npm install -g live-server

# start a auto-reloading server in the current directory
live-server
```
